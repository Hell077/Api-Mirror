## üìù Configuration File

`Api-Mirror` uses a configuration file in YAML format that defines details about the API (endpoints, methods, fields, and responses).

### Sample Configuration:

```yaml
API_MIRROR:
  SERVER: "localhost"
  PORT: "5000"
  API_LIST:
    API_Name:
      address: "/api/example"
      method: "POST"
      fields:
        name:
          type: "string"
          mask: "Anna"
        age:
          type: "int"
          mask: "20"
      responses:
        200: "OK"
        201: "Created"
        400: "Bad Request"
        500: "Internal Server Error"
      title: "Some Title"
    API_Name2:
      address: "/api/example2"
      method: "GET"
      responses:
        200: "OK"
        202: "Accepted"
        403: "Forbidden"
      title: "Another Title"
    API_Name3:
      address: "/api/example3"
      method: "POST"
      fields:
        name:
          type: "string"
          mask: "Anna"
        age:
          type: "int"
          mask: "20"
      responses:
        200: "OK"
        201: "Created"
        400: "Bad Request"
        500: "Internal Server Error"
      title: "Some Title"
```

- `SERVER`: The server where your API is hosted (e.g., localhost).
    - `PORT`: The port where your API is accessible (e.g., 8080).
    - `APIList`: A list of API endpoints with their details.

Each endpoint contains:
- **Title**: The name of the API.
    - **Address**: The URL of the API endpoint.
    - **Method**: The HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.).
    - **Fields**: Input fields for the endpoint.
    - **Responses**: Possible HTTP responses with codes and descriptions.

## üíª Usage

### Running the Application

Once you add the executable file `Api-Mirror` to your `PATH`, you can run it from the terminal. To generate API documentation, use the following command:

```bash
Mirror --path "/path/to/config.yaml" --port [optional, a free port will be chosen]
```

- `--config` (required): Path to the YAML configuration file.
    - `--output` (required): Path where the generated HTML documentation will be saved.

### Example:

```bash
Mirror --config api_config.yaml --output api_documentation.html
```

This command will generate HTML documentation based on the configuration file `api_config.yaml` and save it to the file `api_documentation.html`.

## üîß Flag Support

For more detailed customization, you can use additional flags. Here are some useful options:

- `--config <path>`: Path to the YAML configuration file.
    - `--output <path>`: Path to save the HTML documentation.
    - `--help`: Show the list of all available flags.

---

## üìå Notes

- Ensure that the configuration file is properly set up before running.
    - You can use various flags and command-line parameters to customize the program's behavior.
    - If you encounter any errors or issues, contact support at the [Api-Mirror Issues](https://github.com/Hell077/Api-Mirror/issues) repository.
